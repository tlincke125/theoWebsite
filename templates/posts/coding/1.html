                        I was inspired to create this website from Devon Crawford and Maureen Lincke, you can find
                        their websites
                        in the <a class="text-white" href="{% url 'about' %}">about</a> tab on the navbar. I have always
                        been interested in back-end programming,
                        working on algorithms and deeper software; however, I've never been able to apply this more
                        conceptual computer
                        science content to a user friendly experience. Thus, I've created this website to begin to
                        delve into user interaction
                        and interfaces.

                        Unlike most of my projects, I won't go into as much detail on the face value aspects of my
                        website because they're
                        mostly self explanatory. To build this site, I didn't really rely on any popular frameworks
                        like react or angular,
                        instead, I mostly hard coded the html, css and javascript. This was mainly to familiarize
                        myself with the basic
                        scripting languages. For my next projects (I will be building a few people some websites to
                        showcase their artwork,
                        when those are up I'll write a new post) I will be learning how to use React JS to speed up the
                        process significantly.
                        I also have a lot of projects planned to showcase some backend programming including an
                        authentication service that collects data on users to display the most relevant information. I
                        will also be working on a search
                        algorithm that I will be implementing on the site. Generally, this is mostly a blog, so it
                        doesn't have that much in terms
                        of backend.

                                I came into building this website with no experience in javascript at all. However,
                                javascript is a relatively simple
                                front end language to learn quickly. The javascript on my site is used to store
                                comments and contact information whenever
                                you submit a comment or a query on the contact page. It then sorts through the comment
                                data and displays only the relevant
                                comments for each post. Right now, the main page has a list of ongoing posts. I will be
                                working on a way to display popular
                                posts based on the number of hits and the release date etc.

                                I will have to work on some way to embed code on each page itself. Some of my pages
                                will have live demonstrations (check out
                                my math post <a class="text-white text-dark" href="/posts/math/1/">here</a>
                                on attractors and you'll see what I mean). I can use
                                Django to work in python, but this won't allow me to easily upload my java files or C.
                                I have also looked into code compilers
                                that compile one code into another such as PyJs. Generally, though I have been working
                                in the IDE processing and using the
                                P5.js library to create live graphics of my code.

                                HTML and CSS aren't really programming languages because they're static. They can't
                                work with data or dynamic processes like
                                other languages can. However, getting into these two scripting languages has helped me
                                better understand the connection
                                between dynamic and static languages. I found that learning these languages really
                                bridged the gap between complex computer
                                algorithms and how we can implement back end programming into the front end. Learning
                                how to work with DOM (document object manipulation)
                                and how languages like javascript can pull elements from static scripts really helped
                                me in programming.

                            I was originally going to store my data in mySQL using SQL and PHP. However, I didn't have
                            a strong grasp of PHP (and furthermore SQL
                            because the two are very closely linked). Generally, it seems like these two languages are
                            better suited for when you're storing
                            data on your own server. Otherwise, by using cloud based databases like firebase, you don't
                            really need to have a database manager
                            like mySQL. I might work with these two languages in the future, but for now, I'll be
                            focusing on other projects.

                    For this website, I didn't use a local database, I used a cloud based database called Firebase.
                    Firebase allows you to store
                    data very easily on the cloud and manage the data very easily. It also has a variety of functions
                    you can use in your javascript
                    and it is a very easy interface for creating interactive and responsive websites. Definitely check
                    it out.

                    I hope to continue working on this website and migrate it over to another site once I've become
                    more proficient at web development.
                    Now, however, I'll be putting most of my focus on other projects that I will be featuring on the
                    site. The whole reason I built this
                    was to introduce myself to web development and I think taking a formal course would be very
                    benificial before I go on building more
                    websites for the public domain. I hope you enjoy my site and reading about my projects!
