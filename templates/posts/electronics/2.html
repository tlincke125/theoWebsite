                            If you haven’t read about the first hackathon project (link is right <a href="/posts/electronics/1/">here</a>),
                            go check that out. This is a continuation of that project, where we built the UI and set up
                            a web app for working with the roomba from any location.
                            A continuation of our first hackathon project, this time, our team worked on a user
                            interface for easy access to the roomba’s control system. With any personal home robot, the
                            control system should be as intuitive as possible. Previously, the roomba we built was run
                            solely on the command line of the operating system on top of the robot. This makes it very
                            inconvenient for anybody to use because they have to manually set the robot before letting
                            it loose. This time, we created a very basic webapp that had manual controls and a
                            livestream of the robot’s path. This app was being run on a local server, so it was
                            completely accessible to wifi. Thus, the user would be able to travel outside of their
                            house and still have full control of their robot (as well as being able to scan the house
                            remotely). There are so many uses for this, however, our main ideas included the
                            implementation of a scanning service for children or the elderly, so parents or adults can
                            keep an eye on their children or parents and make sure they are safe in their house. We
                            were able to send audio over wifi, so the user could be able to record themselves and send
                            an audible message to the roomba. However, we did not have enough time to implement this in
                            our web app partly due to the amount of processing (the computer sitting on the roomba was
                            processing everything because we weren't using a commercial processing server like firebase
                            or Azure, so everything done on the website was being done on the computer).

                            static because the roomba is not connected to a server, so the buttons will have no
                            response.

                            The roomba we used was not connected to the cloud in any way. To get it connected, we had
                            to set up a local server on our machine running the roomba so that we could send HTTP POST
                            requests from our webapp to the roomba. We used ngrok to tunnel our local host ports to the
                            public, creating a temporary server. This server was only in charge of hosting the site.
                            Our laptop was the processing unit. We could have dedicated all of our server side logic to
                            a seperate server like firebase or Azure, however, the problem was the code needed USB
                            serial data from the machine hooked up to the roomba. This has an easy fix, just allow
                            azure or firebase access to our USB data, but we couldn’t figure out how to do this in time
                            (this was another last minute project that didn’t work until 10 minutes before we were
                            about to present).

                                To run the web app, we used Flask, a microframework using python (flask is like
                                reactjs, but for python). It would have been easier to use a javascript based
                                framework, however, all of our original code was in python, so we thought it was easier
                                to stay consistent. We set up a virtual environment in python so that we could dedicate
                                all of our packages to the project. For this project we used the packages flask, opencv
                                and at the end, we used twilio (a messaging api), to send a text message to our phone
                                when there was perceived motion in the house. Unfortunately, running a livestream, a
                                webapp and opening a webhook through twilio was just too much for our local machine on
                                the roomba so we did not implement the texting class.

                            An efficient household robot should have multiple functionalities. The functionality we
                            coded for in our project was only manual control, however we wanted to set up an area on
                            the website that would launch the robot into an autonomous roaming mode. Thus, we would
                            have two large buttons on the web app that would tell the roomba to start executing it’s
                            image following algorithm as well as a button that would launch the roomba into it’s idling
                            state (the actual vacuuming protocol pre programmed on the bot). We could include more
                            functionalities, however these were the two we had access to. We weren’t able to get these
                            working only due to time, however, the project structure keeps this in mind and imports our
                            original code. To make the code more efficient, it would be helpful to make the robot a
                            class with an id that corresponded to the user’s account id, a state variable (roaming,
                            following, manual control), a set of methods (roam, image following etc.) and some other
                            properties. If the robot were object oriented, it would be easier to create a user profile
                            / account that could control it using pre built methods in the class. This way, an account
                            would be an object that had a robot as well as all the security properties that a user
                            account should have. Again, there wasn’t enough time to implement all of this, so instead,
                            the website was open to anybody, leaving the robot easy to control from any wifi connected
                            machine.
