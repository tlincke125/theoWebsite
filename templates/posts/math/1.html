                            As any student learns, mathematics can either be algebraic or geometric. An algebraic
                            equation is one that does
                            not relate a current term with its previous term. The independent variable is related only
                            to the independent variable.
                            However, a geometric sequence is one in which each dependent variable is dependent on the
                            previous dependent variables.
                            An example of this is the fibonacci series, in which each term is the sum of the two terms
                            before it. A common property of
                            geometric sequences is their relationship to fractals, or infinitely recursive images. Take
                            pascal's triangle, for example.
                            If I were to go into every property of pascal's triangle, this would be a much longer page,
                            however, one interesting way to
                            create pascal's triangle is a halving algorithm.

                        <p>
                            To better understand this algorithm, refer to the black canvas below. The instructions are
                            very simple. Pick three
                            random points on the canvas to form a triangle. These will be our "anchor" points. For now,
                            keep the increment number
                            at one to understand the algorithm. Proceed by clicking on the canvas. There will be random
                            dots being placed in seemingly random
                            places. The way these dots are being placed is by the halving algorithm. Each time you
                            click, the algorithm chooses two points,
                            one of which is a random anchor point (from the original three points). The other is the
                            current state point. The first time you
                            click, this current position is another random anchor point, however, each other iteration
                            is the dot that was just placed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The algorithm then proceeds to place another point (that will be our next current point)
                            halfway between the current point and
                            the random anchor point. You can keep placing dots on the canvas, however, if we increase
                            the increment count by entering a valid number
                            in the input form, we can speed this process up. (The only difference is the program does
                            the halving algorithm n times where n
                            is the increment number.) Go ahead an enter a new number. I encourage you to work your way
                            up, so start at 1, then go to 100, then 500, then
                            1000. From there the pattern seems very clear. It begins to form a very recognizable
                            triangle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The program is relatively instantaneous up to about 10000. 100000 takes about 3 seconds and
                            1000000 takes about 15 seconds to compute.
                            To reset, just click the go button after you have entered a valid number.

                        non-sequentially like we could with an algebraic formula. Instead, we must place each dot one
                        by one, one after the other.

                            This method of placing dots in places according to previous positions and probability is a
                            very common way to make
                            interesting fractals. With enough time and excitement for fractals, a math student may find
                            themselves inventing other
                            rules based on probability and chance. However, here are some more fun patterns.

                                Another very fascinating pattern exists by using the rules of matrices and
                                transformations. Barnsley's fern is
                                a pattern found when you do one of four things with each iteration. You have an x
                                coordinate and a y coordinate
                                and every iteration, you change your x, y coordinate pair by one of the four following
                                transformations. (The formulas
                                are courtesy of wikipedia).

                                F1 is undergone with a 1% chance, f2 with an 85% chance, f3 with a 7% chance and f4
                                with a 7% chance. To form barnsley's
                                fern, the coordinate pair (x, y) starts at the position (0, 0). Each iteration, you
                                undergo one of these translations
                                based on their respective probabilities and place a point at the resulting (x, y)
                                coordinate pair. I've written a quick
                                program in python that iterates through this process (you can find that on the linked
                                github page) 10000 times and I
                                received the following image in my coordinate plane.

                                games to create a variety of
                                different leaf patterns (by changing the transforming matrices slightly) so that the
                                game has a more natural feel.

                                A more advanced fractal, the Lorenz Attractor, is formed by using a system of linearly
                                homogeneous ordinary differential
                                equations like the ones below.

                                I won't go into much detail on how the system works. Essentially, The equations
                                describe a fluid that is heated from underneath
                                and cooled from above. x is the rate of convection (so the derivative of x is the
                                second derivative of convection), y is the
                                horizontal temperature difference and z is the vertical temperature difference. Sigma
                                rho and beta are physical constants that describe
                                the Prandtl number, Rayleigh number and some other physical constants. By graphing
                                these three differential equations on a three dimensional
                                axis, we get the following figure.

                                damped system of differential equations
                                and you will realize that this can really describe any physical process that involves
                                the rate of change of a three body
                                system like a brushless dc motor, chemical equation, or electrical circuit. These are
                                some examples and generally, the Lorenz
                                attractor can describe many very interesting fundamental processes.

                                simple rules, you can create many extremely intricate and detailed patterns which makes
                                them
                                almost artistic. They are so easy to create as well. Give it a little bit of time and a
                                knowledge
                                of recursion and anybody can make any arbitrary rules that turn into something complex
                                and intricate.
